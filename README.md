This website is a photo gallery built using Next.js, Contentful, Cloudinary, and Tailwind. Its primary function is to showcase a portfolio of images, along with sample text for context. The website sources its data from Contentful CMS and utilizes static site generation for its page rendering.

Key features of the site include a photo gallery with images for each project and an about page. The site also has detailed pages for each photo, which are created using static paths, and uses sharp and plaiceholder for blur backgrounds.

This website was based on the image gallery template from [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example), and the original demo is available [here](https://nextconf-images.vercel.app/)
